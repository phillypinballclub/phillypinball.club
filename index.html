      <h3>Join the club</h3>
      <p>The PPC is a club for everyone. Whether you're looking for good competition, or just a low key time with some excellent people, we've got you covered.</p>
      <p>We welcome all skill levels, but we're especially interested in finding beginners and folks who are new to the scene. Our members range from brand new players to seasoned competitors, and we're all out to have fun. Come on out and join us!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h3>Venue</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h3>Cost</h3>

      <h2>Season Details</h2>
    </header>
    <div class="box">
      <h3>How to Join</h3>
      <p>Show up at the venue during league night! We start playing at 7:30pm, and you can sign up on the spot, at any point in the season.</p>
      <p>Philly Pinball Club is a an IFPA-approved league, which means every member will also earn points towards their international pinball world ranking!</p>
    </div>

    <div id="format" class="box">
      <h3>Meeting Format</h3>
      <p>Each meeting follows a <em>Match Play</em> format, where players compete against one another in groups of 4. You'll be randomly grouped with 3 other people for the night, and your group will play a series of 4 games together.</p>
      <p>Your goal for each game is to beat as many of your group members as possible. In this format, we don't record any actual game scores — instead, you'll earn points based on where you finish in each game (1st through 4th). We'll use those points to calculate your position in the season's <a href="/standings">Standings</a>, which ultimately determines your seed position in the Finals.</p>
      <p>If you've never played competitively (or never played Match Play format), the best thing you can do is show up for league night! We'll always review the rules for any new folks before we get started, and you'll be paired with other members that will be happy to show you the ropes. By the end of the night you'll have the whole thing down.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h3>Schedule</h3>
      <p>Our Summer season runs for <strong>8 weeks</strong> and begins on <strong>July 9th</strong>.</p>

      <p>No venue-hopping this time around, we're changing it up and moving to weekly meetups on <strong>Monday nights</strong> at <strong>Barcade</strong> in Fishtown.</p>

      <p>Every Monday at 7:30pm we'll be playing for points in our standard match-play format (more on that <a href="#format">here</a>). In addition to league points, our final tournament will be structured as a separate IFPA event and open to everyone who has paid league dues.
      </p>

      <p>Feel free to bring friends and guests to any of our league nights — they'll always get to play for free their first time around.</p>

      <p>Full dates for the season are below, which you can also track as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/624058467974965/">Facebook events here</a>.</p>

      <h3>Final Tournament</h3>
      <p>If you're a PPC member, you're automatically qualified for the end-of-season tournament, where we give out cash for the top finishers and ridiculous prizes for everyone. Your scores during the regular season will determine your seeding in the tournament, and the number of strikes you earn will determine whether you end up playing for the A division title or the B division title.</p>
      <p>We'll send out more details as the Finals draw closer, but rest assured — it's the most fun night of the season and not one to miss!</p>
