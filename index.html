      <h3>How to Join</h3>
      <p>Show up at the venue during league night! We start playing at 7:30pm, and you can sign up on the spot, at any point in the season.</p>
      <p>Philly Pinball Club is a an IFPA-approved league, which means every member will also earn points towards their international pinball world ranking!</p>

      <h3>Schedule</h3>
      <p>Our Winter season runs 8 weeks and begins on <strong>January 18th</strong>.</p>
      <p>We're trying something a little different this season: each week will rotate between play for fun and play for IFPA points. Nights that we play for fun will be casual affairs with a loose structure, and nights that we play for points will be run in our standard match-play format and count towards a player's seed position in the final tournament. Check out the <em>Meeting Format</em> section below for more details.</p>
      <p>Additionally, our final tournament will be structured as a separate IFPA event and will be open to everyone who has paid league dues.</p>

      <h3>Final Tournament</h3>
      <p>If you're a PPC member, you're automatically qualified for the end-of-season tournament. Your scores during the regular season will qualify you for A, B, or C Division where you’ll face players of similar skills in the finals. Prizes are given for the top finishers in all three Divisions.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="content" class="box">
      <h3>Meeting Format</h3>
      <p>This season has two formats, held on alternating weeks. On odd weeks, we'll use the <em>Hangout</em> format, which is unstructured play with your PPC pals. On these nights we might talk strategy, learn some new skills, or try to beat the GC on Barcade's Addams Family. It's a loose affair, and the only goal is to provide a time for folks to get together and play.</p>
      <p>On even-numbered weeks, our format is <em>Match Play</em>, where players will compete against one another in groups of 4. You'll be randomly assigned a group for the night, and will accumulate points based on where you finish in each game (1st through 4th). We'll use those points to calculate your position in the season's Standings, which will determine the Division you'll play in for the Finals.</p>

    <div id="content" class="box">
      <h3>Win a Game!</h3>
      <p>We're giving away a vintage game at the end of the season, and every registered player will be eligible to win. The winner will be chosen via a random drawing during the Finals tournament.</p>
